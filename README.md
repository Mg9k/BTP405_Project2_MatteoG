# Product Name: TableMaster

Scrum is implemented through GitHub’s issues and milestones. They will be visible within this repository but screenshots will shown here as documentation.

## Sprint 1: Project Preparation
![Sprint 1](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/1f639b6e-5149-45c5-8eef-c454dba1a09b)

### Issue 1: Product Vision
![Sprint 1 Issue 1](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/dae092b4-24b7-470a-b4ff-e2464d835c7c)

The product vision will be used to get a better idea at how the final product is meant to work.

#### Product Vision
_For_ restaurant managers and owners _who_ want to easily manage customer reservations for their restaurant, _the **TableMaster** is a_ restaurant reservation system _that_ allows customers to make and manage their reservations online. _Unlike_ other restaurant reservation systems such as OpenTable, TableMaster is made with user-friendliness in mind, allowing for ease of use and control over reservations for both customers and restaurant staff. _Our product_ offers an interface for staff to view and manage booking availability, customer information, and receive notifications about new reservations or updates to existing reservations.

The above product vision has been added as a comment on the issue, and the issue, having been therefore completed, has been closed.

### Issue 2: Develop User Stories, Personas and Scenarios

![Sprint 1 Issue 2](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/a0469fd8-366e-4520-aa96-9d4b89338c85)

Making sample personas, scenarios and stories will help in understanding the needs of the product’s end users so that the finished product may meet those needs.

#### User Stories, Personas and Scenarios
Note: for all personas and scenarios, the current year is 2024.

#### Customer:
##### User Stories:
1. As a customer, I want to create an account so that I can make reservations.
2. As a customer, I want to select specific tables, the time that I’ll be eating, and the size of my party for my reservation.
3. As a customer, I want to be put on a waiting list if my desired reservation is taken.
4. As a customer, I want to be able to reschedule or cancel my reservations.
5. As a customer, I want real-time updates on the status of my reservation.

##### Persona:
_Personalization:_
- Name: John Doe
- Age 48
- Married 23 years ago. Has a daughter who is 13, soon to graduate elementary school.
- Currently living in Vaughan, ON with his family.

_Job-Related:_
- He and his wife owns a small local bakery
- Manages inventory and staff. Sometimes helps bake.
- The couple started the bakery 20 years ago.

_Education:_ 3 year apprenticeship for baking.

_Relevance:_
Believes TableMaster is beneficial for:
- Making reservations ahead of time.
- Booking online rather than by phone.

##### Scenario:

_Objective:_ 
Booking a reservation for a small family party to celebrate daughter’s graduation from elementary school (user stories 1, 2, 4, 5).
Not picky about specific seats, but would rather do it on a specific day and would like to wait for an open table if no seats are available that day (user story 3).

_What's involved in the activity?:_ 
- Creating an account.
- Finding a date and time.
- Finding open tables for the above date and time.
- Having the option to be put on a waiting list if seats are full during the customer’s desired date (both for a single table and for restaurant seats as a whole).
- Being able to cancel or reschedule the reservation if an emergency comes up.
- Receiving notifications for any reservation updates (i.e. successfully booked, cancelled, waitlist updates, etc.)

_How to address the problem:_
- Customers should be able to create an account for TableMaster.
- Customers should be given a list of tables to select from, and times the tables will be available for the day.
- If their desired table is taken, customers should have the option to be put on a waiting list, in case the customer who originally booked the table cancels or reschedules their booking.
- If the restaurant is full for the customer’s desired time, the waitlist should allow for waiting for any table openings rather than for a single specified table.
- Customers should be able to cancel or reschedule reservations
- Customers should receive notifications through the email they used to create their account as soon as updates happen.

#### Restaurant Staff

##### User Stories
1. As restaurant staff, I want to set and manage the available tables in my restaurant.
2. As restaurant staff, I want to view and manage upcoming reservations.
3. As restaurant staff, I want to be notified of any reservations made by customers or updates to those reservations so that I can prepare accordingly.
4. As restaurant staff, I want to analyze customer data provided by the booking system.

##### Persona

### Issue 3: Set up MongoDB Database

![Issue 3](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/cfc1a216-42c7-403e-b5e9-c0f9cb25f2a1)

A database named ‘TableMaster’ has been set up on MongoDB with not only a collection for the end-users of the program, but also a second collection for the tables of the restaurant, as per the needs of the user stories.

![Sprint 1 Issue 3 DB](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/add940cd-5d68-494d-b624-45f7795f4e67)

Within the ‘users’ collection, two sample users have been created, one for each type of end-user. Below is the data for both sample users created based on their personas, scenarios and user stories.

_Customer_

![Sample User 1](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/04610c0b-aca2-4be8-b391-e913c8bd731b)

_Staff_

![Sample User 2](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/7af418d4-c5bf-4928-8f40-cd940d386ac2)

Notes:
* Both users have a 'login' object with the parameters that will be used as their login information. These are to be used in a future sprint that focuses on account security (passwords to get encryption, phone number and/or email to be used for 2FA).
* Customers have object arrays for upcoming reservations for active booking purposes. There are also object arrays for past reservations for customer analytics purposes.
* Reservation status can be either 'confirmed', 'waitlisted' or 'cancelled'.
* Upcoming/Previous reservation objects will have notes that customers may choose to add upon booking their reservation. Customers may enter preferences or anything else that they'd like to inform their waiting staff.
* Upcoming/Previous reservation objects will have duration elements, which are two date values set to UTC time.
* Staff have little information stored in their database documents since they are admin users. 

Within the ‘tables’ collection, ten sample tables were created. Below are screenshots of three of them.

![Sample Table 1](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/26f3e77f-63c4-4d05-a679-4c67f3bfe213)
![Sample Table 2](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/5caeb2e7-8b3c-4ffe-a535-9cb850fa8eb0)
![Sample Table 3](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/2cd34b79-c750-4657-8aad-8a5bea9478cc)

Notes:
* Tables have a minimum and maximum capacity.
* Tables have tags dictating what type of tables they are (i.e. booth seating, next to window, round/square tables, outdoor, etc.). These are included for the sake of customer preference.
* Tables have an object array for upcoming reservations which are very similar in data to that which customers have. These are also used for active booking purposes.

With the database set up with sample data in place, this issue can be closed as complete.

### Sprint 1 Completion

With all Sprint 1 issues closed, the Sprint is marked as completed
![Sprint 1 Complete](https://github.com/Mg9k/BTP405_Project2_MatteoG/assets/123207493/9caf53da-91ae-4252-a0d7-1592860d237b)

### Sprint 1 Retrospective

Working on this sprint gave me a much better idea of my next steps and how my program should look when it is complete. 
Creating the product vision gave me some very useful clarity regarding its main functionality and what my program is meant to be as a whole.
The user stories also gave me much needed info as well. Understanding each user's roles and needs were simple, but elaborating on them allowed me to see a much bigger picture, like how the program's booking system would work, how previous reservations would be archived and how staff would use admin permissions. The biggest understanding I've gotten from working on the sample users was how I needed a seperate MongoDB collection for the restaurant's tables.
Similarly, making the MongoDB database also helped me realize what elements were needed to make the sample data templates, such as tables having a minimum and maximum seating capacity as opposed to a single capacity value, as well as tags.
