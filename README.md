### Issue 1: Product Vision
[s1issue1.jpg]
The product vision will be used to get a better idea at how the final product is meant to work.

#### Product Vision
_For_ restaurant managers and owners _who_ want to easily manage customer reservations for their restaurant, _the **TableMaster** is a_ restaurant reservation system _that_ allows customers to make and manage their reservations online. _Unlike_ other restaurant reservation systems such as OpenTable, TableMaster is made with user-friendliness in mind, allowing for ease of use and control over reservations for both customers and restaurant staff. _Our product_ offers an interface for staff to view and manage booking availability, customer information, and receive notifications about new reservations or updates to existing reservations.

The above product vision has been added as a comment on the issue, and the issue, having been therefore completed, has been closed.
