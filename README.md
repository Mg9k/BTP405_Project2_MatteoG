### Issue 1: Product Vision
[s1issue1.jpg]
The product vision will be used to get a better idea at how the final product is meant to work.

#### Product Vision
_For_ restaurant managers and owners _who_ want to easily manage customer reservations for their restaurant, _the **TableMaster** is a_ restaurant reservation system _that_ allows customers to make and manage their reservations online. _Unlike_ other restaurant reservation systems such as OpenTable, TableMaster is made with user-friendliness in mind, allowing for ease of use and control over reservations for both customers and restaurant staff. _Our product_ offers an interface for staff to view and manage booking availability, customer information, and receive notifications about new reservations or updates to existing reservations.

The above product vision has been added as a comment on the issue, and the issue, having been therefore completed, has been closed.

### Issue 2: Develop User Stories, Personas and Scenarios

[s1issue2.jpg]
Making sample personas, scenarios and stories will help in understanding the needs of the product’s end users so that the finished product may meet those needs.

#### User Stories, Personas and Scenarios
Note: for all personas and scenarios, the current year is 2024.

#### Customer:
##### User Stories:
1. As a customer, I want to create an account so that I can make reservations.
2. As a customer, I want to select specific tables, the time that I’ll be eating, and the size of my party for my reservation.
3. As a customer, I want to be put on a waiting list if my desired reservation is taken.
4. As a customer, I want to be able to reschedule or cancel my reservations.
5. As a customer, I want real-time updates on the status of my reservation.

##### Persona:
_Personalization:_
- Name: John Doe
- Age 48
- Married 23 years ago. Has a daughter who is 13, soon to graduate elementary school.
- Currently living in Vaughan, ON with his family.

_Job-Related:_
- He and his wife owns a small local bakery
- Manages inventory and staff. Sometimes helps bake.
- The couple started the bakery 20 years ago.

_Education:_ 3 year apprenticeship for baking.

_Relevance:_
Believes TableMaster is beneficial for:
- Making reservations ahead of time.
- Booking online rather than by phone.

##### Scenario:

_Objective:_ 
Booking a reservation for a small family party to celebrate daughter’s graduation from elementary school (user stories 1, 2, 4, 5).
Not picky about specific seats, but would rather do it on a specific day and would like to wait for an open table if no seats are available that day (user story 3).

_What's involved in the activity?:_ 
- Creating an account.
- Finding a date and time.
- Finding open tables for the above date and time.
- Having the option to be put on a waiting list if seats are full during the customer’s desired date (both for a single table and for restaurant seats as a whole).
- Being able to cancel or reschedule the reservation if an emergency comes up.
- Receiving notifications for any reservation updates (i.e. successfully booked, cancelled, waitlist updates, etc.)

_How to address the problem:_
- Customers should be able to create an account for TableMaster.
- Customers should be given a list of tables to select from, and times the tables will be available for the day.
- If their desired table is taken, customers should have the option to be put on a waiting list, in case the customer who originally booked the table cancels or reschedules their booking.
- If the restaurant is full for the customer’s desired time, the waitlist should allow for waiting for any table openings rather than for a single specified table.
- Customers should be able to cancel or reschedule reservations
- Customers should receive notifications through the email they used to create their account as soon as updates happen.

#### Restaurant Staff

##### User Stories
1. As restaurant staff, I want to set and manage the available tables in my restaurant.
2. As restaurant staff, I want to view and manage upcoming reservations.
3. As restaurant staff, I want to be notified of any reservations made by customers or updates to those reservations so that I can prepare accordingly.
4. As restaurant staff, I want to analyze customer data provided by the booking system.
